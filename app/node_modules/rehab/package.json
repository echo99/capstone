  "readme": "# Rehab\n\nRehab helps you deal with your coffee dependency\n\n## Why do you think you're here?\n\nIf you need to work with multiples CoffeeScript files and need to join then into a single JavaScript file at the end, Rehab is wating for you. \n\nYou won't immediately realize you have a problem. Just a few .coffee files here and there and all you need is ```coffee --join``` to make it work.\n\nThen, one day, you realize you need more! You need your files to have order or it won't work properly. And that little friend transpiler [won't help](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/2673#issuecomment-12372037). You start making maneuvers, like huge Cakefiles, file lists(!) or even put your files in alphabetic order (!!!). But one day you stop and think \"There should be a better way to do that! I need help!\"\n\nYes, we know... That's why we are here.\n\n\n## No, no, no!\n\nRehab deals with coffeescript dependency using a simple tag ```#_require [filename]``` on the file that have dependencies.\n\n```coffeescript\n#_require ../filenameA.coffee\n#_require ../filenameB.coffee\n\nclass app.Model2\n\n```\n\nWith that on your troublesome files and Rehab will give you a list of files in the right order so you can use it, for instance, with your Cakefile:\n\n```coffeescript\n{exec} = require 'child_process'\nRehab = require 'rehab'\n\ntask 'build', 'Build coffee2js using Rehab', sbuild = ->\n  console.log \"Building project from src/*.coffee to lib/app.js\"\n\n  files = new Rehab().process './src'\n  \n  to_single_file = \"--join lib/app.js\"\n  from_files = \"--compile #{files.join ' '}\"\n\n  exec \"coffee #{to_single_file} #{from_files}\", (err, stdout, stderr) ->\n    throw err if err\n```\n\n## License\n\nÂ©2012 David Lojudice Sobrinho and available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php):\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
